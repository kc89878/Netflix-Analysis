## Business Questions

We will leverage these questions to optimize Netflix's content strategy and enhance audience engagement for increased profitability.

1. For each **director** count the number of movies and tv shows created by them in separate columns for directors who have created **tv shows** and **movies** both?

2. Which five **countries** has highest number of **comedy** movies?

3. For each year (as per date added to netflix), which **director** has maximum number of movies released?

4. What is average **duration** of movies in each **genre**?

5. Find the list of **directors** who have created **horror** and **comedy** movies both?
